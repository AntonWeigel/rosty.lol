      SEO (Search Engine Optimization) isn’t about hacks. It’s about helping the
      right people discover your product when they’re looking for a solution.


      If your site has good structure, clear content, and basic metadata, you’re
      already ahead of most competitors.

      These are the basic things every SaaS website should have:

      * A short, clear **page title** and **meta description**
      * **Open Graph** and **Twitter Card** tags for better link previews
      * A **sitemap.xml** and **robots.txt** file
      * Fast loading speeds (especially on mobile)
      * Clear content hierarchy using H1, H2, H3
      * Proper use of alt text for images

      Keywords are important - but they should appear naturally.


      Don’t repeat the same phrase in every sentence. Instead, write clearly
      about the problems you solve, the features you offer, and the benefits
      your users get.


      If a human understands it, search engines will too.

  - text: Structure Your Content Clearly

  - content: >
      Use clear headlines to break up content. Use bullet points when listing
      benefits or features. Use short paragraphs. This helps both readers and
      search engines understand what’s important.


      Every blog post, landing page, and help article should follow this
      structure.

      SEO works best when it’s part of your product from the start. Setting up
      metadata, link previews, performance optimizations, and a sitemap early
      means you don’t need to retrofit them later.

      A strong foundation ensures your site is ready to grow as soon as you
      launch.
