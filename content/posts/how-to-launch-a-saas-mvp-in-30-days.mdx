      Launching a SaaS MVP doesn’t need to take months. In fact, shipping faster
      gives you a better shot at real feedback, less burnout, and a tighter
      product. With the right approach and tools, you can go from zero to live
      in just 30 days.


      This guide breaks down what to focus on - and what to skip - so you can
      move with confidence.

    _template: header
  - content: >
      Don’t start with features - start with pain. Define a specific problem, a
      real user, and the *core job* they want done.


      A good MVP solves one pain point well. Write a one-sentence value
      proposition. Define your ideal user. And resist the urge to build too
      much.

    variant: Secondary
    _template: header
  - content: >
      Sketch out the basic user flow - landing page, sign-up, dashboard, and
      main feature.


      Pick a stack that lets you move quickly: for example, Next.js 15,
      Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and TinaCMS. Starting with a modern template can
      save weeks by giving you ready-to-use structure and components.

    variant: Secondary
    _template: header
  - content: >
      Now it’s time to build - but only the must-haves. Login, one main feature,
      and a basic UI is enough.


      Use fake data if needed. Skip edge cases. Push to production early (use
      Vercel or Railway) and iterate live.
    _template: text
  - text: 'Week 4: Polish, Publish, and Promote'
    variant: Secondary
    _template: header
  - content: >
      In the final week, add just enough polish to make it usable. Set up a
      changelog, add one blog post, and polish the landing page. Don’t aim for
      perfect - aim for feedback.


      Announce it to a focused audience (X, Reddit, indie hackers) and start
      collecting feedback.


      Done is better than perfect.
