      Technology stacks are no longer about buzzwords - they’re about workflows.
      What helps you ship faster, scale easier, and iterate with confidence?


      In this post, we’ll look at a lean, modern SaaS tech stack that balances
      speed, integration quality, and long-term maintainability.

    variant: Secondary

  - content: >
      * **Frontend:** `Next.js 15` with the App Router, React 19, and full
      support for Server Components and layouts.

      * **Backend:** `Supabase` for Postgres, edge functions, real-time APIs,
      and powerful SQL access.

      * **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS` with dark mode support and design tokens
      powered by CSS variables.

      * **Authentication:** `Supabase Auth` with social login, passwordless
      support, and SSR integration via `@supabase/ssr`.

      * **CMS:** `TinaCMS` for editing content directly inside the app - fully
      integrated with markdown and JSON structures.

      * **UI Components:** `shadcn/ui` + `Lucide` + headless primitives for
      accessibility and flexibility.

      * **State & Data:** React 19 cache, SWR for API hooks, and local state via
      `useState` and `useRef`.

      * **Types:** TypeScript with strict mode for type-safe DX.

      * **Hosting:** `Vercel` for instant deploys, preview environments, and
      edge function support.

      While the core setup is lean and opinionated, we also include optional
      tools to boost developer productivity:


      * **Lemon Squeezy** – Subscription and licensing infrastructure for SaaS
      monetization.

      * **React Email** – Transactional email templates powered by Tailwind CSS.

      * **Zod** – Schema validation with strong TypeScript support.

      * **ESLint + Prettier + Husky** – Consistent code formatting and
      pre-commit hooks.

      * **Playwright + Vitest** – For integration and unit testing.


      These are either built-in or easy to drop in when you scale beyond MVP.

      This setup is battle-tested across real SaaS launches. It balances
      flexibility with structure:  React’s latest features, a scalable backend,
      modern developer tools, and zero vendor lock-in.  


      If you're starting a new SaaS project in 2025, this stack can save you
      weeks of setup and help you scale with confidence.
