description: A good landing page is not about decoration - it’s about structure and clarity

      Many landing pages fail because they try to impress rather than convert.
      An effective page isn’t about flashy visuals or vague taglines - it’s
      about clarity, trust, and guiding the user toward one key action.


      In this post, we’ll break down how to design a landing page that drives
      signups using a proven structure you can adapt for any SaaS project.

    variant: Secondary
    _template: header
  - content: >
      1. **Hero** - Clear headline, supporting subhead, and one strong CTA.
      Remove all distractions here.

      2. **Problem** - Show that you understand the user's pain better than they
      do. Be specific.

      3. **Solution** - Introduce your product and how it solves that exact
      problem. Use benefits over features.

      4. **Social Proof** - Testimonials, logos, or metrics that build trust
      instantly.

      5. **Call to Action** - Repeated at the bottom, with no ambiguity. Make it
      easy to take the next step.


      That’s the skeleton. Add optional sections like feature highlights, use
      cases, or FAQ if they support the core goal.

      * **Clarity beats cleverness**: No buzzwords. Use simple, direct language.

      * **Visual hierarchy**: Make important things obvious. Use size, contrast,
      and spacing intentionally.

      * **Single purpose**: One page, one CTA. Remove anything that doesn’t
      serve that goal.

      * **Speed matters**: Optimize performance. Use modern image formats and
      avoid layout shifts.


      It’s not about being fancy - it’s about being clear, confident, and
      conversion-focused.

      conversion-focused best practices in mind. With editable sections via

      project.


      You don’t need to be a designer to build something effective. Follow the
      structure - and ship confidently.
